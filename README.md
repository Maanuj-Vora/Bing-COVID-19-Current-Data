[Major(Country) Names and IDs](https://maanuj-vora.github.io/Bing-COVID-19-Current-Data/countryNamesIDs.json)


This repository also archives the data each day, and since Bing only provides us with daily data, I do not have access to prior data as of 3/22/2020, but you can access anything from 3/22/2020 onwards, all of these files will be located in the /docs/archived/ directory. To use the link you would have to do [https://maanuj-vora.github.io/Bing-COVID-19-Current-Data/archived/mm-dd-yyyy.json](https://maanuj-vora.github.io/Bing-COVID-19-Current-Data/archived/3-22-2020.json)*. 

*Note that for the month, you do no need to include a 0 if it is a single digit month.
